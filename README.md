# Cascal
###This is my Toy Compiler.
It has many disabilities.I specially wrote a file to show what things it can't do.As for why it is named 'Cascal',because I used Pascal-like variable declaration and C-like grammar :-) .The proudest thing is that I will finish it by hand.I will also put my refrence code here.
